ðŸ“Œ Task 1 â€“ Titanic Data Preprocessing

ðŸ”„ Steps Performed

Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored its structure.

Handled missing values in Age (median), Embarked (mode), and Fare (median).

Encoded categorical variables like Sex and Embarked.

Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) for uniform scaling.

Visualized outliers using boxplots and applied scaling instead of removal.

Exported the cleaned dataset as cleaned_titanic.csv.

ðŸ“Œ Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ”„ Steps Performed

Generated summary statistics to understand data distribution.

Plotted histograms for numeric features to check spread and skewness.

Used boxplots for Age and Fare to detect outliers.

Created a correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships.

Made feature-level observations (e.g., Fare and Age influence on Survival).
