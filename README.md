AIML internship tasks and projects

Titanic Dataset Tasks:

Overview:

This repository contains the step-by-step solution for the AI/ML internship tasks focusing on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. All code, cleaned datasets, visualizations, and brief explanations are included.

ðŸ“Œ Task 1 â€“ Titanic Data Preprocessing

Objective: Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for ML.

ðŸ”„ Steps Performed

- Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored its structure using head(), info(), describe(), and isnull().sum().

- Handled missing values:

  - Age â†’ filled with median.
  
  - Embarked â†’ filled with mode.

- Encoded categorical variables: Sex and Embarked using one-hot encoding.

- Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler for uniform scaling.

- Visualized outliers using boxplots; applied scaling instead of removing them.

- Exported the cleaned dataset as cleaned_titanic.csv.

Files Added:

  - train.csv (original dataset)
  
  - cleaned_titanic.csv (cleaned dataset)
  
  - Task 1 code notebook/script

ðŸ“Œ Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Understand data using statistics and visualizations.

ðŸ”„ Steps Performed

- Generated summary statistics (describe(include='all')) to understand data distribution.

- Plotted histograms for all numeric features to check spread and skewness.

- Plotted boxplots for all numeric features to detect outliers.

- Created a correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships.

- Created pairplots to visualize interactions between features and survival.

- Made feature-level observations:

  - Higher-class passengers (Pclass=1) had better survival.

  - Females (Sex=0) survived more than males.

  - Younger passengers had slightly better survival than seniors.

  - Extreme Fare values indicate anomalies.

Files Added:

  - Task 2 code notebook/script
  
  - Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots
  
  - Observational notes and inferences
